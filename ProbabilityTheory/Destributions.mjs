 *
 * Where:
 * ( n ) is the number of flips.
 * ( k ) is the number of heads you want.

// Poisson Distribution
/**
 * Imagine you have a magic clock that tells you how many emails you get every
 * hour. Sometimes you get more emails, sometimes fewer, but on average, you get
 * about 2 emails per hour. The Poisson distribution helps us figure out the
 * probability of getting a certain number of emails in a given time period, based
 * on this average rate.
 *
 * Key Points
 * - Average Rate ((\lambda)): This is the average number of emails you get per hour. In your case, (\lambda = 2).
 * - Time Period: We're looking at the next hour.
 * - Number of Events (k): This is the number of emails you might get in the next hour.
 * - e: Euler's number, approximately 2.71828.
 *
 * _______________________________________________________
 *
 * Example: How Many Emails Will I Get in the Next Hour?
 * Let's say you want to know the probability of getting exactly 3 emails in the next hour.
 * Average Rate ((\lambda)): 2 emails per hour.
 * Number of Emails (k): 3.
 * Using the formula: [ P(3; 2) = \frac{2^3 \cdot e^{-2}}{3!} ]
 *
 * Let's calculate it step-by-step:
 * - Calculate ( 2^3 ): [ 2^3 = 8 ]
 *
 * - Calculate ( e^{-2} ): [ e^{-2} \approx 0.1353 ]
 *
 * - Calculate ( 3! ): [ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 ]
 *
 * - Put it all together: [ P(3; 2) = \frac{8 \cdot 0.1353}{6} \approx \frac{1.0824}{6} \approx 0.1804 ]
 * ---> So, the probability of getting exactly 3 emails in the next hour is approximately 18.04%.

/**
 * Imagine you have a box of crayons, and all the crayons are exactly the same size

 * random. Since all the crayons are the same, you have an equal chance of picking
 * any one of them. This is what the Uniform Distribution is like.
 *
 * Key Points
 * - Equal Chance: Every outcome has the same probability.
 * - Range: The outcomes are spread evenly over a certain range.
 * - Example: Picking a Random Number
 *
 * _______________________________________________________
 * Let's say you have a number line from 1 to 10. If you close your eyes and point to a number on this line,
 * you have an equal chance of pointing to any number between 1 and 10. This is a Uniform Distribution.
 *
 * _______________________________________________________
 * Visualizing the Uniform Distribution
 * Imagine a straight line from 1 to 10. Every point on this line is equally likely to be chosen.
 * If you were to plot this on a graph, it would look like a flat, horizontal line because every number has the same chance of being picked.

 * Key Points
 * - Average (Mean): The middle point of the distribution where most students' heights are clustered.
 * - Spread (Standard Deviation): How spread out the heights are from the average.
 * A small spread means most students are close to the average height, while a large spread means the heights vary more.
 *
 * _______________________________________________________
 * Heights of Students
 * Let's say the average height of students in the class is 4 feet, and the standard deviation is 0.5 feet.
