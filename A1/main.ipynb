    "## Task 1 – Rough-cut modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Olympus Träningscenter Gym\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example of rough-cut modeling, we choose to model a gym as a system where gym members (later members) are treated as customers and workout stations (later stations) (e.g., cable machines, cardio machines, free-weight, weight machines) are treated as servers. To simplify the system, we are going to assume there are no peak hours in the gym and number of members is equally distributed among the day. For the sake of example and to have a better understanding, we choose the campus gym Olympus Träningscenter (later Olympus), but this could apply to any traditional gym system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, there are 4 different types of stations with various number of machines/benches available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 8 cable machines\n",
    "  - Average time spent on a cable machine is 5 minutes\n",
    "- 18 cardio machines\n",
    "  - Averate time spend on a cardio machine is 30 minutes\n",
    "- 4 free-weight benches\n",
    "  - Average time spent on free-weight bench is 10 minutes\n",
    "- 12 weight machines\n",
    "  - Average time spent on weight machines bench is 10 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Olympus it is not as crowded as in bigger commercial gyms and we would say that the average arrival time is 20 members per hour. We have two types of members: \n",
    "\n",
    "- ones who focus only on cardio (25% of all members)\n",
    "  - they only come to the gym to do cardio and do not use other equipment\n",
    "- other who focus on muscle building\n",
    "  - They use all types of stations.\n",
    "  - Each member of this type (simplification) has the same workout routine consisting of starting with cardio, then free-weight, then cable machine, and finishing with weight machine\n",
