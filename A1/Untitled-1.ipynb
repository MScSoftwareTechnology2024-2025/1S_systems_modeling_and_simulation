    "### 1.1 Olympus Träningscenter Gym\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example of rough-cut modeling, we choose to model a gym as a system where gym members (later members) are treated as customers and workout stations (later stations) (e.g., cable machines, cardio machines, free-weight, weight machines) are treated as servers. To simplify the system, we are going to assume there are no peak hours in the gym and number of members is equally distributed among the day. For the sake of example and to have a better understanding, we choose the campus gym Olympus Träningscenter (later Olympus), but this could apply to any traditional gym system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, there are 4 different types of stations with various number of machines/benches available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 8 cable machines\n",
    "  - Average time spent on a cable machine is 5 minutes\n",
    "- 18 cardio machines\n",
    "  - Averate time spend on a cardio machine is 30 minutes\n",
    "- 4 free-weight benches\n",
    "  - Average time spent on free-weight bench is 10 minutes\n",
    "- 12 weight machines\n",
    "  - Average time spent on weight machines bench is 10 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Olympus it is not as crowded as in bigger commercial gyms and we would say that the average arrival time is 20 members per hour. We have two types of members: \n",
    "\n",
    "- ones who focus only on cardio (25% of all members)\n",
    "  - they only come to the gym to do cardio and do not use other equipment\n",
    "- other who focus on muscle building\n",
    "  - They use all types of stations.\n",
    "  - Each member of this type (simplification) has the same workout routine consisting of starting with cardio, then free-weight, then cable machine, and finishing with weight machine\n",

    "we can summarize the system's performance based on key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cardio Machines**:\n",
    "The utilization (ρ) for the cardio machines is moderate at around 55%, meaning that these machines are busy just over half the time. However, the very low idle probability (P₀ = 0.000045) suggests that it is highly unlikely to find all machines idle at any point. With an average of 10.02 members in the system (L), most users spend about 0.501 hours (30 minutes) at the machines, which aligns with the service time of 30 minutes. Queue waiting time (W₁) is minimal, showing that members rarely have to wait for an available machine. This indicates that the cardio machines are efficiently managed despite their high utilization​\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Free-Weight Benches**:\n",
    "Free-weight benches have a higher utilization rate of 62.5%, indicating frequent use. The idle probability (P₀ = 0.073) is relatively higher than that of the cardio machines, meaning these benches are occasionally unoccupied. With an average of 3.03 members using or waiting for the benches (L), members spend around 0.202 hours (12 minutes) in the system, including an average waiting time of 0.036 hours (2.16 minutes). The system is still well-managed, though there is a small chance of waiting due to the high utilization​\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cable Machines**:\n",
    "Cable machines are underutilized with a low utilization of 15.6%, and their idle probability (P₀ = 0.286) is relatively high. On average, only 1.25 members are in the system at a time, meaning that members spend around 0.083 hours (5 minutes) on these machines, which perfectly matches the expected service time. There is virtually no waiting (W₁ close to 0), showing that the availability of cable machines is more than sufficient, making them an efficient resource in the gym​\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weight Machines**:\n",
    "The weight machines have a low utilization of 20.8%, meaning they are underutilized most of the time. The idle probability (P₀ = 0.082) is relatively small, but the system is still far from overuse. On average, 2.50 members are in the system, and they spend around 0.167 hours (10 minutes) using the machines, matching the service time. Similar to the cable machines, there is practically no waiting (W₁ ≈ 0), making this a highly efficient setup with little risk of delays​\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overall System**:\n",
    "The overall system utilization is notably high at 1.298, which suggests that the gym is overutilized in certain areas, especially cardio and free-weight stations. The idle probability (P₀ = 0.332) indicates that a third of the time, at least one station is available, but the overall high utilization shows the gym is very busy. With an average of 15.11 members in the system, members spend an average of 0.84 hours (50 minutes) in the gym, which includes waiting times (W₁ = 0.028 hours, or about 1.68 minutes) in queues. Overall, the gym runs efficiently, though potential congestion at certain stations like cardio and free-weights could benefit from optimization​\n",
