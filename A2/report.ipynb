    "# Simulation and Analysis of Web Application Booking Services\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A web application provides booking services where customers can choose from among three options upon opening the main page:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flight Booking**\n",
    "- **Flight and Hotel Booking**\n",
    "- **Flight, Hotel, and Car Booking**\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure composed of Virtual Machines (VMs). The current configuration can handle 4 requests in parallel and buffer a total of 6 requests. Observations reveal the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Service Times**:\n",
    "  - Flight Booking: **3 seconds**\n",
    "  - Flight and Hotel Booking: **7 seconds**\n",
    "  - Flight, Hotel, and Car Booking: **12 seconds**\n",
    "- **Request Arrival Rate**: **34 requests per minute**\n",
    "  - 20% choose Flight Booking\n",
    "  - 70% choose Flight and Hotel Booking\n",
    "  - 10% choose Flight, Hotel, and Car Booking\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to a high number of lost requests, the owners plan to improve the infrastructure by adding a VM. The proposed configuration can handle 5 requests in parallel and buffer a total of 5 requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Develop a simulation model to estimate, for both the current and proposed systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **drop rate** (rate at which requests are lost).\n",
    "2. System performance in terms of **utilization** and **response time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare the two configurations and draw conclusions, carefully stating any assumptions or approximations made.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Problem-Solving Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the web application's performance under both configurations, we developed a **discrete-event simulation** using Java. The simulation models the arrival and processing of booking requests over a simulated period of one day (86,400 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model the System Components**:\n",
    "  - **Servers (VMs)**: Represented as processing units handling requests.\n",
    "  - **Buffer (Queue)**: A finite queue to hold requests when servers are busy.\n",
    "  - **Requests**: Different types with varying service times and selection probabilities.\n",
    "- **Implement Event Handling**:\n",
    "  - **Arrival Events**: Simulate the arrival of new booking requests based on an exponential interarrival time distribution.\n",
    "  - **Completion Events**: Represent the completion of request processing.\n",
    "- **Advance Simulation Time**: Use an event-driven approach to progress time to the next scheduled event.\n",
    "- **Collect Statistics**:\n",
    "  - **Drop Rate**\n",
    "  - **Server Utilization**\n",
    "  - **Average Response Time**\n",
    "- **Perform Multiple Runs**: Execute the simulation multiple times to achieve statistical significance and compute confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Event-Graph Specification and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event graph** models the flow of events, illustrating how different events trigger subsequent events and affect the system state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arrival Event (A)**:\n",
    "   - Triggers when a booking request arrives.\n",
    "   - Determines whether the request is processed, buffered, or dropped.\n",
    "2. **Completion Event (B)**:\n",
    "   - Occurs when a server completes processing a request.\n",
    "   - Frees up a server and checks the buffer for waiting requests.\n",
    "3. **Drop Event (C)**:\n",
    "   - Happens when an arriving request cannot be processed or buffered.\n",
    "   - Increments the drop count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Graph Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A → B**: If a server is available, the arrival event schedules a completion event after the service time.\n",
    "- **A → Buffer → B**: If servers are busy but the buffer has space, the request is buffered and processed when a server becomes free.\n",
    "- **A → C**: If servers are busy and the buffer is full, the request is dropped.\n",
    "- **B → Buffer Dequeue**: Upon completion, if the buffer is not empty, the next request is dequeued and processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions and Actions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Service Times**: Based on request type (3, 7, or 12 seconds).\n",
    "- **Buffer Management**: Ensures that requests are buffered up to the maximum capacity.\n",
    "- **Dropping Requests**: Occurs only when both servers and buffer are fully occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "  - **Completion Event Handler**:\n",
    "    - Frees servers upon request completion.\n",
    "    - Processes buffered requests if available.\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Using polymorphism and clear event handlers ensures consistent and maintainable event processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. What Statistics Do You Need? How Do You Compute Them?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Measures**:\n",
    "  - **Drop Rate**: Proportion of dropped requests.\n",
    "  - **Server Utilization**: Fraction of time servers are busy.\n",
    "  - **Average Response Time**: Mean time from request arrival to completion.\n",
    "- **Implementation**:\n",
    "  - **`SimulationStatistics`** class collects and computes statistics.\n",
    "- **Computation Methods**:\n",
    "  - **Drop Rate**:  $ \\text{Drop Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Total Dropped Requests}}{\\text{Total Arrived Requests}} $\n",
    "  - **Utilization**: $ \\text{Utilization} = \\frac{\\text{Total Busy Time}}{\\text{Total Simulation Time}} $\n",
    "  - **Average Response Time**: Mean of all recorded response times.\n",
